## Summary
This citizens’ initiative seeks to strengthen the **prevention, reporting, and sanctioning of workplace harassment in Spain** by promoting **healthy leadership** in public and private organizations. The central proposal is to **periodically evaluate people in supervisory roles** using transparent, measurable criteria regarding conduct, team climate, and respect for fundamental rights, in order to reduce harassment and other harmful practices at work.

It is inspired by global data—such as Gallup’s *State of the Global Workplace* report—showing that healthy workplaces not only improve mental health, but also productivity and equity.

The goal is for this initiative to serve as a model for Spain, Europe, and other countries committed to dignified and safe work.

## Why it matters
- Harassment and toxic leadership **damage health**, productivity, and equal opportunities.  
- Clear evaluation standards help **prevent abuse** and **detect risks early**.  
- A common framework improves **legal certainty** for employees and employers.

## Key measures (high level)
- **Periodic supervisory evaluations** with objective indicators (conduct, communication, fairness, and team well-being).  
- **Confidential reporting channels** and guarantees against retaliation.  
- **Training** for managers and staff on respectful leadership and early detection.  
- **Corrective actions and sanctions** where appropriate, with follow-up.  
- **Support for victims** (guidance, protection measures, referral to services).  
- **Monitoring and transparency** through periodic aggregate reports.  
- **Public sector as a benchmark**, extending good practices to suppliers and partners.
